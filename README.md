# Gameplan

- Step 1: Quick intro of who we are, why are we doing this, and what we hope to get out of it. 
- Project's Title
- Project Description
- Table of Contents
- How to install and run the project
- can they input their own source of data?
- include credits
- (this has to be at the top) but add license and shields at the top
- https://shields.io/


what are we going to do: 
- import all of our data into our jupyter notebook
- do head to see a little bit of it
- hella graphs (look for outliers)

Data Preparation:
- SQL 
- Python(Pandas)

ML/DL
- do regression/classification(ML/DL)
- NN(PyTorch)

Data Visualization:
- Tablaeu
- Chart js 

Steps:
- Load data into SQL & Python 
- Preview Data 
- Visualize Errthing
- Clean data  

1) research questions
2) data analysis visualization and methodology 
3) coonclusino
4) reflection and improvements


With all this in mind, here is our project!

## Starting the Project

### Data Cleaning 
- go from csv to excel back to csv
- how is SQL being used here
- fianlly get a clean data set that can be put into python for more analysis

### Tableau Data Visualization
- how was tableau used
- what are we trying to get from this
- how is the visuals of tableau helping us

### Python-based Visualization
- imported into python using pandas
- did the basic plots
- the stuff we have here with the cleaned data is lining up with what we have in tableau

### Regression in Python
