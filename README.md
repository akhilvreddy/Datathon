# Gameplan

- Step 1: Quick intro of who we are, why are we doing this, and what we hope to get out of it. 
- Project's Title
- Project Description
- Table of Contents
- How to install and run the project
- can they input their own source of data?
- include credits
- (this has to be at the top) but add license and shields at the top
- https://shields.io/


what are we going to do: 
- import all of our data into our jupyter notebook
- do head to see a little bit of it
- hella graphs (look for outliers)

Data Preparation:
- SQL 
- Python(Pandas)

ML/DL
- do regression/classification(ML/DL)
- NN(PyTorch)

Data Visualization
- Tablaeu
- Chart js 

Steps:
- Load data into SQL & Python 
- Preview Data 
- Visualize Errthing
- Scatter, Histogram
- Clean data
